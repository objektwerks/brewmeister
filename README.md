Process
-------
1. Sanitizing - Santize all brewing tools and containers.
2. Preparing - Prepare all ingredients for a brewing session.
3. Malting - Dry and optionally roast germinated grains (barley, wheat, oats or rye) for ***milling***.
4. Milling - Grind malted grains into a ***grist***, exposing its starches for ***mashing***.
5. Mashing - Mix hot water with the ***grist*** to convert its starches into fermentable sugars, known as a ***wort***.
6. Lautering - Filter out solids from the ***wort***.
7. Boiling - Bring the ***wort*** to a boil; then, add hops for bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
8. Cooling - Cool the ***wort*** using an ice bath or immersion chiller, bringing it down to the recommended temperature.
9. Whirlpooling - Stir the ***wort***, collecting hop solids, or ***trub***, at the bottom-center of the kettle. Optionally add hops.
10. Fermenting - Add yeast to the ***wort***, converting sugars into alcohol and CO2. Typically takes 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
11. Conditioning - Let the ***wort*** mature and develop its unique flavor profile. Typically takes 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
12. Filtering - Optionally filter the ***wort*** to further clarify and stabilize.
13. Packaging - Bottle, keg or cask the ***wort***.
