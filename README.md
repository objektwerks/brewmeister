Process
-------
>Steps used in ***all grain*** brewing. ***Extract*** brewing will exclude steps 3 - 7.
1. Sanitizing - Santize all brewing tools and containers.
2. Preparing - Prepare all ingredients for a brewing session.
3. Malting - Dry and optionally roast germinated grains (barley, wheat, oats or rye) for ***milling***.
4. Milling - Crush malted grains into a ***grist***, exposing its starches for ***mashing***.
5. Mashing - **Transfer** the ***grist*** to a ***mash tun*** with boiling water (148 - 158F). Then stir and let set for 60m, converting starches into fermentable sugars - known as the ***wort***.
6. Lautering - Filter out solids from the ***wort***.
7. Sparging - Pour hot water on the ***wort*** and stir to extract sugars from the grains.
8. Boiling - **Transfer** the ***wort*** to a ***brew kettle*** and bring to a boil. Then add hops as required. Sustain boil for 60m.
9. Cooling - Cool the ***wort*** using a chiller, bringing it down to 70F or lower.
10. Whirlpooling - Stir the ***wort***, collecting hop solids, or ***trub***, at the bottom-center of the kettle. Optionally add hops.
11. Fermenting - **Transfer** the ***wort*** to a ***fermenter***. Then **pitch** ***yeast*** into the ***wort***, allowing for the conversion of sugars into alcohol and CO2. Let ferment for 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
12. Conditioning - Let the ***wort*** mature and develop its unique flavor profile. Let condition for 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
13. Packaging - Bottle, keg or cask the ***fermented and conditioned wort***.
