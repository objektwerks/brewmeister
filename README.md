Process
-------
1. Sanitizing - Santize all brewing tools and containers.
2. Preparing - Prepare all ingredients for a brewing session.
3. Malting - Dry and optionally roast germinated grains (barley, wheat, oats or rye) for ***milling***.
4. Milling - Crush or gound malted grains into a grist, exposing the starches for the ***mashing***.
5. Mashing - Mix hot water with the grist to convert the starches into fermentable sugars, creating a sugar-rich liquid called ***wort***.
6. Lautering - Filter out solids from the ***wort***.
7. Boiling - Bring the ***wort*** to a boil; then, add hops for bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
8. Cooling - Give the ***wort*** an ice bath, bringing it down to recommended temperature.
9. Whirlpooling - Stir the ***wort***, removing protein and hop solids, or ***trub***. Optionally add hops.
10. Fermenting - Add yeast to the ***wort***, allowing sugars to be converted into alcohol and CO2. Typically takes 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
11. Conditioning - Let the ***wort*** mature and develop its unique flavor profile. Typically takes 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
12. Packaging
