Process
-------
1. Sanitizing - Santize all brewing tools and containers.
2. Preparing - Prepare all ingredients for a brewing session.
3. Malting - Dry and optionally roast germinated grains (barley, wheat, oats or rye) for ***milling***.
4. Milling - Crush malted grains into a ***grist***, exposing its starches for ***mashing***.
5. Mashing - Pour the ***grist*** into boiling water (148 - 158F). Then stir and let set for 60m, converting starches into fermentable sugars - known as the ***wort***.
6. Lautering - Filter out solids from the ***wort***.
7. Sparging - Sprinkle hot water on the ***wort*** to extract sugars from the grains.
8. Boiling - Bring the ***wort*** to a boil; then, add hops for bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
9. Cooling - Cool the ***wort*** using a chiller, bringing it down to 70F or lower.
10. Whirlpooling - Stir the ***wort***, collecting hop solids, or ***trub***, at the bottom-center of the kettle. Optionally add hops.
11. Fermenting - Add yeast to the ***wort***, converting sugars into alcohol and CO2. Let ferment for 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
12. Conditioning - Let the ***wort*** mature and develop its unique flavor profile. Let condition for 2 weeks. Optionally add hops.
13. Packaging - Bottle, keg or cask the ***fermented and conditioned wort***.
