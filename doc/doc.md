Brewmeister
-----------
>Beer brewing simulator that allows brewers to **build** recipes and **brew** batches using the classic
>beer brewing process of sanitizing, preparing, malting, milling, mashing, lautering, sparging, boiling,
>cooling, whirlpooling, fermenting, conditioning and kegging.

>Allows a brewer to:
1. **define** a beer recipe;
2. **provide** batch input properties; and
3. **simulate** the brewing of a batch via the 13-step beer brewing process.

>In other words, Brewmeister can simulate the entire beer brewing process - without all the hard work,
>allowing a brewer to run ***what-if*** scenarios using different beer recipes and batch input properties.
